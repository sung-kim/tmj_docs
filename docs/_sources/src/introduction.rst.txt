Introduction
=============================

TMJ (Transmuter Junior) is a prototype chip based on the Transmuter gem5 design.
Most of the software idioms and APIs are preserved, however there are some differences compared to gem5.

The fastest way to develop a new application would be to read the "Quick Start" guide in the ``tm_junior`` repository.
The guide has steps to run simulations, and walks through a couple basic demo applications.

For porting code from gem5 to the TMJ ASIC (or TMJ FPGA port), see the API reference and API comparison to gem5.
It's also good to be mindful of some general programming and debug limitations.
